# Lag Balancer by Pykess
-------------------------------------

**This mod does *NOT* magically decrease lag**

The purpose of this mod is to try to ensure all players have roughly equal ping. Since ping cannot be magically decreased through software, instead all players have their ping increased to roughly match the player with the highest ping.

This means that no player has an inherent advantage from having higher ping, since all players will have roughly the same ping.
